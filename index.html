        <h2>Suryanamaskaras</h2>
        <p>Surya namaskar is a full-body energizer sequence that combines 12 yoga poses with rhythmic breathing and
            mantras salutation to the sun. Also named ‘The Ultimate Asana’ or ‘The King of Yoga’, Surya Namaskar
            literally translates as Sun Salutation.

            Getting into the meaning of Surya Namaskar clearly expresses that it is a technique of saluting the Sun with
            all dedication. Going deeper into Surya namaskar’s origin gives us a glimpse of the importance of this
            practice;</p>
        The term, Surya Namaskar has been originated from Sanskrit roots. “Surya” refers to “Sun” and “Namaskar” is
        further a combination term composed of “Namah” means “to pray” and “Kara” is “hand”.

        Namaskar is the gesture of joining hands like in Anjali Mudra and the first pose of this sequence (Prayer pose)
        shows an offering to the Divine. However, in the context of Surya namaskar, the 12 prostration practitioner
        does, laying his body face-down on the ground in the direction of the sun, are the different form of namaskars
        (salutations) to the divine. The divine in this mundane world is no other but is the sun only.
